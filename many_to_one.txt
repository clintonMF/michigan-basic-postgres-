this file houses the logic and the SQL commands required to make a many to many relationship from csv file
NOTE: this procedure is only allowed if the data from the csv file is all you need. If it is not additional commands will be 
required to add extra data which are not in the csv file.


1. we need to copy the csv file into a dummy table
# creating a table that will house name and gender as well as the gender_id
CREATE TABLE dummy(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(122),
    gender CHAR(1),
    gender_id integer
);

2. next is to create a table that will have the distinct number, it will serve as the foreign table
# this table will have the gender and an id.
CREATE TABLE gender(
    id sERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    gender CHAR(1)
);

3. the last table would be the child table this table will be a replica of the dummy table without the gender column
CREATE TABLE name(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(122),
    gender_id integer
);

the commands 
\copy dummy(name, gender) from 'prac.csv' delimiter ',' csv;

INSERT INTO gender(gender) SELECT DISTINCT gender FROM dummy;

UPDATE dummy SET gender_id = (select id from gender where gender.gender = dummy.gender);

INSERT INTO name(name, gender_id) SELECT name, gender_id FROM dummy;


to see both tables combined
select name.name as name, gender.gender as gender from name join gender on gender.id=name.gender_id;
